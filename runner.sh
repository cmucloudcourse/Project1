# You may use other files or scripts in these functions as long as they are in

# All files MUST include source code (e.g. do not just submit jar or pyc files).
#
# We will suggest tools or libraries in each question to enrich your learning.
# You are allowed to solve questions without the recommended tools or libraries.

# The colon `:` is a POSIX built-in basically equivalent to the `true` command,
# REPLACE it with your own command in each function.
# Before you fill your solution,

  #
  # Question:
  # Fill this function to filter the input stream read from the dataset `pageviews-20161109-000000.gz`
  # and redirect the output stream to a file called `output`.
  # You need to read the gz file directly as the input stream, instead of
  # uncompressing and then reading it.
  # You need to redirect the standard output stream to a file named `output`,
  # instead of using File I/O.
  #
  # One possible approach is to use `zcat` to uncompress the gz file to StdOut
  # and pipe it to your data filter program.
  #
  # Examples:
  # zcat pageviews-20161109-000000.gz | python data_filter.py
  # zcat pageviews-20161109-000000.gz | java -cp project1.jar edu.cmu.scs.cc.project1.DataFilter

  # DO NOT compile java code in this function,
  # you should put the `mvn` or `javac` command in the setup() function

q1() {
  # (5 points) read a TSV file to a DataFrame and calculate descriptive
  # statistics
  #
  # Question:
  # Print column-wise descriptive statistics of the output file.
  #
  # 1. the statistics metrics required are as follows (in a tabular view):
  #       monthly_view  daily_view  daily_view ...  daily_view
  # count     ...           ...         ...             ...
  # mean      ...           ...         ...             ...
  # std       ...           ...         ...             ...
  # min       ...           ...         ...             ...
  # 25%       ...           ...         ...             ...
  # 50%       ...           ...         ...             ...
  # 75%       ...           ...         ...             ...
  # max       ...           ...         ...             ...
  # 2. the statistics result should be in CSV format
  # 3. format each value to 2 decimal places
  #
  # A DataFrame represents a tabular, spreadsheet-like data structure containing
  # an ordered collection of columns.
  # As you notice, there is an intuitive relation between DataFrame and TSV
  # files.
  #
  # Use the pandas lib to read a TSV file and generate descriptive statistics
  # without having to reinvent the wheel.
  #
  # Hints:
  # 1. pandas.read_table can read a TSV file and return a DataFrame
  # 2. be careful that you should not read the first record as the header
  # 3. figure out the method of pandas.DataFrame which can calculate
  # descriptive statistics
  # 4. figure out the parameter of pandas.DataFrame.to_csv to format the
  # floating point numbers.
  #
  # You can solve the problem by filling in the correct method or parameters
  # to the following Python code:
  #
  # <import libs on your own>
  # df = pandas.read_table('output', index_col=1, encoding='utf-8', <params>)
  # df.<method>.to_csv(sys.stdout, encoding='utf-8', <params>)
  #
  # `index_col=1` means the second column of the input file, i.e. `page_title`
  # will be read as indexes.
  #
  # Standard output format:
  # count,6130.00,6130.00,...,6130.00
  # mean,235884.75,6356.04,...,7256.01
  # std,433129.27,13291.35,...,19867.40
  # min,100005.00,0.00,...,22.00
  # 25%,118625.25,3089.00,...,3395.25
  # 50%,151206.50,4221.00,...,4616.50
  # 75%,228864.00,6332.75,...,6835.00

q2() {
  # (Honors task) introduction to Series
  #
  # Question:
  # Print the 95th percentile of daily pageviews on Nov 9.
  #
  # The other basic Data Structure in pandas is Series.
  #
  # 1. a DataFrame can be thought of as a dictionary of Series:
  # each column is a Series and all the Series share the same index.
  # 2. Series is a one-dimensional array-like object containing an array of data
  # and an associated array of data labels, called its index.
  #
  # The workflow to solve this question can be as follows:
  # 1. read the file as a DataFrame
  # 2. select the column of Nov 9
  # 3. calculate the 95th percentile
  #
  # In this question, you will explore one of the approaches to get a column
  # from a DataFrame: integer position based selection (iloc).
  #
  # Read the "Selection By Position" section at:
  # https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html
  #
  # You can solve the problem by filling in the correct positions or parameters
  # to the following Python code:
  #
  # <import libs on your own>
  # df = pandas.read_table('output', index_col=1, encoding='utf-8', <params>)
  # print("%.2f" % df.iloc[<positions>].<method>)
  #
  # Standard output format:
  # <a decimal value with 2 decimal places>
  :
}

q3() {
  # (Honors task) the essence of a Series is a dictionary
  #
  # Question:
  # Print the first 5 records in the output file along with monthly pageviews
  # as a JSON object.
  # The keys are the articles and the values are the pageviews.
  #
  # A series can be thought of a dictionary/map in essence.
  # A dictionary/map can be represented as a JSON object, which is an unordered
  # set of name/value pairs.
  #
  # Hint:
  # 1. use pandas.DataFrame.iloc[pos] to select the monthly_view column as a
  # Series
  # 2. the naming of the method which converts a pandas.Series to JSON is
  # self-explanatory
  # 3. to select the first 5 records, you can choose one of the following
  # approaches:
  # 3.1. use a method of pandas.Series similar to GNU tool `head` which
  # returns the first n rows
  # 3.2. use pandas.Series.iloc[pos]
  #
  # Standard output format:
  # {"Donald_Trump":17838479,"AMGTV":10521834,"Proyecto_40":9321993,
  # "United_States_presidential_election,_2016":9016683,"Melania_Trump":6443631}
  :
}

q4() {
  # (Honors task) rank DataFrame and break ties
  #
  # Question:
  # `senators.txt` has a list of articles about United States senators and
  # senators-elect. Please rank the senators and senators-elect by the
  # monthly pageviews. Print the ranked result as a JSON object.
  #
  # The keys of the JSON object are the articles, and the values are the
  # rankings (not pageviews).
  #
  # If the name of a senator or senator-elect does not exist in `output`, do
  # not include it in the ranking.
  #
  # Use "dense ranking" to deal with ties, a.k.a "1223" ranking.
  # If A ranks ahead of B and C (which compare equal) and both ranked ahead of
  # D, then A gets ranking number 1 ("first"), B gets ranking number 2
  # ("joint second"), C also gets ranking number 2 ("joint second") and D gets
  # ranking number 3 ("third").
  # Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking
  #
  # There is no need to (re)implement your own ranking algorithm.
  # pandas.DataFrame.rank enables users to choose from different ways to
  # assign a rank to tied elements.
  #
  # One possible solution is as follows:
  #
  # <import libs on your own>
  # monthly_view = pandas.read_table('output', index_col=1, encoding='utf-8', \
  # <params>).iloc[<positions>]
  # pandas.read_table('senators.txt', index_col=0, encoding='utf-8').join( \
  # monthly_view, how='inner')
  # print(monthly_view.rank(<params>).<methods>.to_json())
  #
  # Standard output format:
  # {"Barbara_Boxer":16,"Chuck_Schumer":10,...,"Rand_Paul":17,"Ted_Cruz":9}
